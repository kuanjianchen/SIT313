In the sit313 project 1, I am going to develop a flag quiz game app. In this app, you will be able to recognize the flags of countries like spain, south korea, iceland, sir Lanka and so on. The features of this game are: Game question about flags of all countries in the world. When you answering the question, we also put a time limit setting into the game, like 5 seconds per question. And there is mode option as well, you can select the easy, medium and hard mode. When you finish the game, you can check your highest score in the score screen.
